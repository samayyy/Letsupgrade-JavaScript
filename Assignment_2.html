	<h1>What is var?</h1>
		<p>avaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime. JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name.</p>
			<h1> var a=10;</h1>

	<h1>What is let?</h1>
		<p>The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used. It is similar to the variable we declare in other languages like Java, .NET, etc.</p>
			<h1> Example: let a =10;</h1>

	<h1>How is let different from var?</h1>
		<p>So the main difference between let and var is, var declares variables globally or locally to entire function regardless of block scope. If you use the let in top of the functions or program, It does not create a global property like var.</p>
	<h1>What is const?</h1>
		<p>Const is a keyword used in ES6 to declare a variable as a constant</p>
			<h1> const a=10;</h1>
	<h1>what is the difference between let and const?</h1>
		<p>If I donâ€™t need to reassign, `const` is my default choice over `let` because I want the usage to be as clear as possible in the code.</p>
